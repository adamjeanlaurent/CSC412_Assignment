plan for v3:

- create locks and threads as we did in version 2, except we don't need to threadLocks or counter locks
- instead we need a new grid of locks and init them at beginning

threadFunc()
{
    while(stillGoing)
    {
        sleepMaybe();
        
        Cell cell = pickRandomCellToUpdate();

        aquireLocksForNeighbors(cell); // lock all 

        updateCell();

        unlockAllNeighborCells();
    }
}
