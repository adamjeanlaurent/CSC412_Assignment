Hello!

Folder Organization:
- This folder "Version2" contains the main program for my Version1 of this assignment.
- Since I had a good amount of re-used functionality between versions 1 and 2, all other source and header files are directly in the "Source" folder so that it can be easily accessed by both Versions.

How To Build And Run Version 2:
- Go to the "Script" folder and run ./script02.sh <path_to_data_files> <output_file_path>
- This script will build all versions and run version2's executable with the given arguments and the highest index in the data files.
- The executable is put into Version2/v2 , but script02.sh will run it for you anyway.
